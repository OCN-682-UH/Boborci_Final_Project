# Boborci_Final_Project

All Materials for Madigan Boborci's Final OCN 682 Project

## Background

This data comes from Dr. Jamie McDevitt-Irwin's work in the Chagos Archipelago. The project used settlement tiles under caged, partially caged, and uncaged treatments to investigate herbivory pressures on benthic community makeup. This data was pulled from analysis of the tiles 1 year after deployment. Below is the Data Dictionary to help inform what each substrate code means. Substrate codes pulled from CoralNet, definitions from CoralNet or notes from Dr. McDevitt-Irwin.

## App
[Here](https://mboborci.shinyapps.io/Final_Project_MB/) is the final ShinyApp for this data.
